# Medication Tracker

A simple web based tracking tool for keeping records about medication usage.

## Access

The latest version of the tool can be found at:

-   <https://connected-web.github.io/medication-tracker/>

## Intent

The tool should:

-   be web based
-   be mobile friendly
-   be toggle friendly
-   be touch friendly
-   give realtime feedback
-   be configurable to assign new drug types
-   act as a recording tool; not a reminder tool
-   no liability will be held for misuse or missed medication as a result of using the tool

## Use case

The tool should work for a variety of medications, for example regular doses Paracetomol and Ibruprofen.

```
Paracetomol   Adults - can usually take one or two 0.5g tablets every four to six hours; to a maximum of 4g (eight 0.5g) per day.
Ibruprofen    Adults – can usually take one or two 200mg tablets every four to six hours; to a maximum of 1,200mg (six 200mg) per day
```

As someone who is self medicating or following a prescription
I should be able to track what time I have taken a medication
So that later I can check when it is ok to take my next dosage
